            Joe "Stapes" Stapleton is a star in the poker world -- as he once put it, he's "poker-famous." He's a longtime poker commentator with credits that include PokerStars, 
            The World Series of Poker, The Big Game, and Poker Night in America. In a wide-ranging and thoughtful conversation, he outlines his path from upstate New York to Hollywood, 
            where he's also a stand-up comic and host of the popular "Poker In The Ears" podcast. Joe originally moved to LA with dreams of being a TV comedy writer; 
            his irreverent sense of humor and willingness to try anything opened doors that he didn't even know existed.

        <p> If you love poker you already know podcast host and commentator Joe Stapleton, who returns to the show to talk about comedy, commentating, and how various aspects of his professional career have been affected by the events of the last two years. We also get to meet Josh Wilson from CryptoHoldem, who talks to the panel about the different parts of cryptocurrencies and NFTs that seem to attract the poker-playing community. You can learn more about Josh and his live no limit texas holdem NFT community (where holders can win a trip to the WSOP!)</p>
