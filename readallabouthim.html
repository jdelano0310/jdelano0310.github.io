        <p>Joe Stapleton is an American stand-up comedian and poker commentator who has been entertaining global audiences for a decade.<br><br>

            In his act Joe delivers the type of self-deprecating humour that if a meal in a restaurant, it would arrive at your table with a disclaimer stating any issues with digestion was on you. Through stand-up, 
            Joe generously explores the human experience and what you get from his act is an intimate and consensual performance full of almost, but not quite taboo humour.</p>

        <p>One thing comedians have to get used to when they go full-time is suddenly finding a lot more of it on their hands. Time, that is. Once they'd do a nine to five, daydreaming of material while staring at spreadsheets, then rush to gigs straight afterwards. Now you get up, stare at a blank Word document or scriptwriting app, daydream about anything but jokes then probably give up and play online poker instead. Which does then give you something to write about.</p>

                Paul Schrader's latest movie, "The Card Counter," focuses on William Tell (Oscar Isaac), a man who has done unforgivable things and has found comfort in, and gotten very good at, playing poker. The film is a character piece, an exploration of how some monsters are made — in Tell's case he became one when he was in the military at Abu Ghraib — and how one man creates a life rife with rituals and routine to cope with what he's done.

                    Written and directed by Paul Schrader of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull fame (highlighting a long and impressive career résumé), the film stars Oscar Isaac, Tiffany Haddish, Tye Sheridan, and Willem Dafoe with Martin Scorsese an executive producer.

                    The film had its world premiere earlier this month at the Venice International Film Festival, with its official release coming last week on Sept. 10. Early reviews have been uniformly excellent, with some already predicting multiple Academy Award nominations when they are announced early next year.

            Most poker fans have had the experience. A poker-related film or television show features action that really doesn’t play out as it would in the real world.

Joe Stapleton knows the feeling. The longtime poker player, commentator, and comedian hopes his role as a poker consultant on the new film The Card Counter helped add more realism to the story. Hopefully, the film won’t leave poker players rolling their eyes.
