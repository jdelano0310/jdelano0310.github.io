                Paul Schrader's latest movie, "The Card Counter," focuses on William Tell (Oscar Isaac), a man who has done unforgivable things and has found comfort in, and gotten very good at, playing poker. The film is a character piece, an exploration of how some monsters are made — in Tell's case he became one when he was in the military at Abu Ghraib — and how one man creates a life rife with rituals and routine to cope with what he's done.

            Most poker fans have had the experience. A poker-related film or television show features action that really doesn’t play out as it would in the real world.

Joe Stapleton knows the feeling. The longtime poker player, commentator, and comedian hopes his role as a poker consultant on the new film The Card Counter helped add more realism to the story. Hopefully, the film won’t leave poker players rolling their eyes.
