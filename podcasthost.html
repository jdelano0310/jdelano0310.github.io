                            Every week, the hosts of PokerStars TV (James Hartigan and Joe Stapleton) bring you a behind-the-scenes look at what it’s like being two regular folks on the international poker circuit.
Told from the perspective of a cranky British dad (Hartigan) and an undateable American bachelor (Stapes), ‘Poker in the Ears’ is a mostly uncensored take on the world of professional poker.
The hosts also regularly call in favours, in the form of guest spots from their big-shot celebrity poker-playing friends. And they routinely hold on-air competitions, providing chances for listeners to join them on tour.
