        <p>One thing comedians have to get used to when they go full-time is suddenly finding a lot more of it on their hands. Time, that is. Once they'd do a nine to five, daydreaming of material while staring at spreadsheets, then rush to gigs straight afterwards. Now you get up, stare at a blank Word document or scriptwriting app, daydream about anything but jokes then probably give up and play online poker instead. Which does then give you something to write about.</p>

            <p>The European Poker Tour (EPT) Prague is taking place right now, and someone who traveled across the pond to be there was
            Joe “Stapes” Stapleton, who commentates EPT broadcasts alongside James Hartigan. The famed duo is actually fresh off
            winning a Global Poker Award for their podcast, Poker in the Ears, and are excited to be reunited in person in the
            booth.</p>
