                                Note: The date should be formatted exactly as it's shown below. In particular, the
                                "least significant" characters of the month should be encapsulated in a <span>
                                element to denote what gets dropped in 1200px mode (eg. the "uary" in "January").
                                Oh, and if you don't need a date for a particular page or post you can simply delete
                                the entire "date" element. 
                
                            -->
            <span class="date"><span class="month">Mar<span></span></span> <span class="day">2</span><span class="year">,
                    2022</span></span>
