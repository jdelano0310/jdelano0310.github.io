                element to denote what gets dropped in 1200px mode (eg. the "uary" in "January").
                Oh, and if you don't need a date for a particular page or post you can simply delete
                the entire "date" element.

        <p> If you love poker you already know podcast host and commentator Joe Stapleton, who returns to the show to talk about comedy, commentating, and how various aspects of his professional career have been affected by the events of the last two years. We also get to meet Josh Wilson from CryptoHoldem, who talks to the panel about the different parts of cryptocurrencies and NFTs that seem to attract the poker-playing community. You can learn more about Josh and his live no limit texas holdem NFT community (where holders can win a trip to the WSOP!)</p>
