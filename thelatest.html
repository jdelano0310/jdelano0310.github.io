                                The Mrs and I went to see @Stapes at the @houseofcomedytx last night and he did NOT disappoint. Absolutely crushed and highly recommend checking him out if he‚Äôs in a city near you.

            In this podcast episode, host Mark Masters chats with comedian Joe Stapleton about his time at the Vail Comedy 
            Festival. Joe recounts learning about the festival from Mark's Twitter and his journey from LA to Vail with his 
            girlfriend and fellow comedian, Jamal Sirleaf. They stayed at the Evergreen Lodge and performed at a free show at 
            the Vail brewery. Joe reflects on his performance, the camaraderie with other comedians like Leah and Brett, 
            and the live podcast "Hippie Not Hippie" with Zach Mass and AJ Finney. The episode captures the lively and 
            enjoyable atmosphere of the festival.

            Joe "Stapes" Stapleton is a star in the poker world -- as he once put it, he's "poker-famous." He's a longtime poker commentator with credits that include PokerStars, 
            The World Series of Poker, The Big Game, and Poker Night in America. In a wide-ranging and thoughtful conversation, he outlines his path from upstate New York to Hollywood, 
            where he's also a stand-up comic and host of the popular "Poker In The Ears" podcast. Joe originally moved to LA with dreams of being a TV comedy writer; 
            his irreverent sense of humor and willingness to try anything opened doors that he didn't even know existed.
