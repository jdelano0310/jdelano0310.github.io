                Written and directed by Paul Schrader of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull fame (highlighting a long and impressive career rÃ©sumÃ©), the film stars Oscar Isaac, Tiffany Haddish, Tye Sheridan, and Willem Dafoe with Martin Scorsese an executive producer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film had its world premiere earlier this month at the Venice International Film Festival, with its official release coming last week on Sept. 10. Early reviews have been uniformly excellent, with some already predicting multiple Academy Award nominations when they are announced early next year.
