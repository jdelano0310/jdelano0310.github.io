        <p>Joe Stapleton is an American stand-up comedian and poker commentator who has been entertaining global audiences for a decade.<br><br>

            In his act Joe delivers the type of self-deprecating humour that if a meal in a restaurant, it would arrive at your table with a disclaimer stating any issues with digestion was on you. Through stand-up, 
            Joe generously explores the human experience and what you get from his act is an intimate and consensual performance full of almost, but not quite taboo humour.</p>

        <p>One thing comedians have to get used to when they go full-time is suddenly finding a lot more of it on their hands. Time, that is. Once they'd do a nine to five, daydreaming of material while staring at spreadsheets, then rush to gigs straight afterwards.

Which does then give you something to write about.</p>
